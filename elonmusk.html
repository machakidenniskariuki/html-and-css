         <h1> early life and Education</h1>
          <p>Musk attended Waterkloof House Preparatory School, <b>Bryanston High School</b>, and then Pretoria Boys High School, where he graduated. Musk was a good but unexceptional student, earning a 61 in Afrikaans and a B on his senior math certification. Musk applied for a Canadian passport through his Canadian-born mother to avoid South Africa's mandatory military service, which would have forced him to participate in the apartheid regime, as well as to ease his path to immigration to the United States. While waiting for his application to be processed, he attended the University of Pretoria for five months.

           Musk arrived in Canada in June 1989, connected with a second cousin in Saskatchewan, and worked odd jobs including at a farm and a lumber mill. In 1990, he entered Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. Two years later, he transferred to the University of Pennsylvania, where he studied until 1995. Although Musk has said that he earned his degrees in 1995, the University of Pennsylvania did not award them until 1997 – a Bachelor of Arts in physics and a Bachelor of Science in economics from the university's Wharton School. He reportedly hosted large, ticketed house parties to help pay for tuition, and wrote a business plan for an electronic book-scanning service similar to Google Books.
    
           In 1994, Musk held two internships in Silicon Valley: one at energy storage startup Pinnacle Research Institute, which investigated electrolytic supercapacitors for energy storage, and another at Palo Alto–based startup Rocket Science Games. In 1995, he was accepted to a graduate program in materials science at Stanford University, but did not enroll. Musk decided to join the Internet boom, applying for a job at Netscape, to which he reportedly never received a response. The Washington Post reported that Musk lacked legal authorization to remain and work in the United States after failing to enroll at Stanford. In response, Musk said he was allowed to work at that time and that his student visa transitioned to an H1-B. According to numerous former business associates and shareholders, Musk said he was on a student visa at the time.

    <h1 style=" color: rgb(47, 0, 255);">X.com and PayPal</h1>
     <p>In 1999, Elon Musk co-founded<b> X.com</b>, one of the first federally insured online banks. Initially successful with over 200,000 customers, X.com faced management challenges, and Musk was replaced as CEO. In 2000, X.com merged with Confinity, a competitor with a popular money-transfer service, PayPal. Following internal conflicts and technological issues, Musk was again replaced as CEO. Under new leadership, the company rebranded as PayPal in 2001 and focused on the payment platform. PayPal was acquired by eBay in 2002 for $1.5 billion in stock, making Musk its largest shareholder with a $175.8 million payout. In 2017, Musk repurchased the X.com domain, citing sentimental value.</p>
        
       <h1 style="color: blue;"> SpaceX</h1>
      <p>  Elon Musk founded <b>SpaceX</b> in 2002 with $100 million to revolutionize space exploration by reducing costs. Early challenges included three failed Falcon 1 launches, almost leading to bankruptcy. However, in 2008, SpaceX succeeded, winning a $1.6 billion NASA contract. The company pioneered reusable rocket technology with the Falcon 9 and achieved major milestones, such as the first commercial spacecraft docking with the ISS in 2012 and the first private crewed mission in 2020. SpaceX is also developing Starship, a reusable spacecraft for interplanetary missions. Its groundbreaking innovations have made it a leader in aerospace technology.</p>
      <h1 style="color: blue;"> tesla</h1>
      <p> Elon Musk joined Tesla in 2004, leading its Series A funding round with a $6.35 million investment. Though not a founder, Musk became chairman and later CEO, following internal conflicts and financial challenges. Tesla introduced its first product, the Roadster, in 2008, revolutionizing electric vehicles. Under Musk’s leadership, Tesla launched several successful models, including the Model S, Model 3, and Cybertruck, and expanded globally through Gigafactories. Tesla became the world’s most valuable carmaker in 2020 and achieved a market capitalization of $1 trillion in 2021. Musk’s vision transformed Tesla into a leader in sustainable energy and electric mobility.</p>

      <h1 style="color: blue;"> solarcity and tesla city</h1>
      <p>In 2006, Elon Musk conceptualized and funded SolarCity, founded by his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive. By 2013, SolarCity became the second-largest solar power provider in the U.S. Musk envisioned a massive solar production facility in Buffalo, New York, completed in 2017. Tesla acquired SolarCity in 2016 for $2 billion, merging it with its battery division to form Tesla Energy. The acquisition faced criticism and lawsuits from shareholders, alleging it was primarily to benefit Musk financially, as SolarCity was facing liquidity issues. However, Musk successfully defended the lawsuit in 2022. Tesla Energy has since focused on integrating renewable energy systems with electric storage solutions.</p>
      <h1 style="color: blue;"> neuralink</h1>
      <p>Elon Musk co-founded Neuralink in 2016 to create brain-computer interface technology. With an investment of $100 million, Neuralink aims to enhance human cognition, treat neurological conditions, and potentially integrate AI with human brains. The company has demonstrated its technology through animal trials, including a macaque playing a video game via a brain implant. Despite these advancements, Neuralink has faced criticism over animal welfare concerns, alleged violations of the Animal Welfare Act, and claims of rushed experiments under Musk’s leadership. In 2023, Neuralink received FDA approval for human trials, marking a significant step toward its ambitious goals.</p>

    <p>Musk is an outlier among executives who typically avoid partisan political advocacy. Musk was a registered independent voter when he lived in California. Historically, he has donated to both Democrats and Republicans, many of whom serve in states in which he has a vested interest. Beginning in 2022, his political contributions have mostly supported Republicans, with his first vote for a Republican going to Representative Mayra Flores. While previously considered relatively apolitical and moderate, Musk has become more politically vocal and supported right-wing positions, notably since acquiring Twitter in 2022, and as of 2024, his views were generally described as right-wing and conservative. In April 2023, Musk described himself as center-right economically and center-left socially, rejecting the conservative label. In 2024, he started supporting international far-right political parties, activists, and causes, and has shared far-right misinformation and numerous conspiracy theories.</p>
       </div>
   
    <p>Musk supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, Hillary Clinton in 2016, Joe Biden in 2020, and Donald Trump in 2024. In the 2020 Democratic Party presidential primaries, Musk endorsed candidate Andrew Yang and expressed support for his proposed universal basic income, and endorsed Kanye West's 2020 presidential campaign. In 2020, he gave over $50 million to Citizens for Sanity, a conservative political action committee. In 2021, Musk publicly expressed opposition to the Build Back Better Act, a $3.5 trillion legislative package endorsed by Joe Biden that ultimately failed to pass due to unanimous opposition from congressional Republicans and several Democrats. In 2022, Musk said he would start supporting Republican Party candidates, and in 2023, supported Republican Ron DeSantis for the 2024 US presidential election, giving $10 million to his campaign, and hosted DeSantis's campaign announcement on a Twitter Spaces event. After this point, Musk hosted a bipartisan set of X Spaces with Democratic and Republican candidates, including Dean Phillips, Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Vivek Ramaswamy, and Donald Trump.</p>

    <p>By early 2024, Musk had become a vocal and financial supporter of Donald Trump. In July 2024, after the attempted assassination of Donald Trump, Musk endorsed him for president. During the presidential campaign, Musk joined Trump on stage at a campaign rally, and during the campaign promoted conspiracy theories and falsehoods about Democrats, election fraud, and immigration, in support of Trump. Musk was the largest individual donor of the 2024 election.</p>
     <p>Musk's international political activity has come under increasing scrutiny, especially in Europe, due to his position in the incoming US government. His actions and comments, especially his support for German far-right political party Alternative for Germany, have been called by some as "foreign interference" in domestic affairs. Musk's comments and actions have received increasing criticism from the governments and leaders of the United Kingdom, France, Norway, Spain, and Germany.</p>
